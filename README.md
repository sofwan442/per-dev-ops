üê≥ What is Docker? (The Core Tool)
Definition: Docker is a platform that allows you to run applications inside a lightweight, isolated box called a Container.

Key Benefits üéØ (Why we use Docker?)
Consistency/Compatibility: The application runs identically everywhere (eliminating the "works on my machine" problem).

Portability: Containers can run on any major operating system (Windows, Mac, or Linux) without modification.

Speed and Efficiency: Containers are lightweight and start up very quickly.

Key Concepts
Containers: Self-contained, executable software packages that include everything an application needs (code, runtime, libraries, environment variables).

Images: Read-only templates used to create containers.

Docker Compose: A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a YAML file.

Benefits
Consistency across all environments

Easy isolation of services

Simple deployment and scaling
